Executive Summary

This credit-risk model uses LightGBM and SHAP to provide interpretable default predictions.
The model achieved a test AUC of 0.644. SHAP enables transparency by identifying
which features contribute most strongly to default risk. The top drivers were:
borrower_feat_2, macro_1, num_past_defaults. Dependence plots reveal nonlinear risk effects and interaction patterns.
Local SHAP explanations show why specific loans were classified as high- or low-risk.
